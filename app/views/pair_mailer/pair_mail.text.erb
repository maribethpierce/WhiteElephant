Howdy <%= @santa.name %>!

THIS IS JUST A TEST:
currently testing: can I have a background image?
and if so, are the words still legible?

For fun, I'm including you in this to see what will happen. If this were the real drawing, you would have drawn:
<%= @recipient.name %> for <%= @group.name %>

When this is finished, we'll make sure everyone is included and draw names for real.

Happy Friday!!
